# Multi-Threading-Image-Processing
This project utilizes OpenCV version 4.11.0 and the x64 Microsoft Cl.exe compiler was used for this project.
Both will needed to be installed and System environments will be needed to be changed for this project.

The project folder will have both the source code, executable, and the environment that was used to compile the code. 
This is the command that was used to compile:
cl /std:c++17 test.cpp /EHsc /I C:/dev/opencv/build/include /link /LIBPATH:C:/dev/opencv/build/x64/vc16/lib opencv_world4110.lib

This command was used to run the executable:
.\text.exe
